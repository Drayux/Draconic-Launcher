# Draconic-Launcher
The open-source Minecraft modpack launcher!

Currently early on in development, this project is a continuation of my over-done Python script that functioned as a custom Minecraft launcher. I created it so that modding the environment could be easier and more convinient. This program aims to support it's own modpacks, as well as those from other popular launchers. It will then create an manages multiple instances of the game for efficient creation of custom modpacks.
